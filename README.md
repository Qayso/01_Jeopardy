<!-- Title: Jeopardy -->                                     

Jeopardy is the first project for Upright Education software programming course. In this project we built a pseudo Jeopardy board game using HTML and CSS. 

<!-- Build Status -->

Currenty complete with 4 different webpages to explore. First Index/homepage, then first round, next second round, and lastly the final round. 

<!-- Tech/Framework -->

In this project we used HTML and CSS. We implented grid system for our game board.We used flex our headers and buttons along with the divs encapsulating our grid framework. We also added images and CSS styling for buttons to make it a bit more "fun". Mostly to play around with and learn CSS. Logo sits up on top left with absolute positioning so it is consistent with all 'rounds' pages.

<!-- How To -->

Unfortunately this is just a template and not an actual game. You can however navigate the webpages with 'Play', Previous and Next Buttons. Game over button on final round does not take you anywhere. However if you pretend you lost, you can click it uncontrollably to help ease your fake lost. Keep your head up King/Queen!
